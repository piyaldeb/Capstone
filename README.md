The sonar technology is one of the key elements of underwater exploration and navigation, however, ability to distinguish between stones and 
mines in problematic ocean environments is still a very challenging issue. This distinction is of utmost importance for submarine safety and,
therefore, to prevent any disasters. In this research, we are eager to deal with the problem previously mentioned through the use of data
analytics on an all-encompassing sonar dataset. This will involve the investigation of a range of techniques to pick out and examine those
aspects that correctly separate rock and mine signatures allowing sonar to be more precise in identifying underwater threats,
and so in providing a much greater degree of safety for submarine operations.


Differentiating between a rock and a mine on a sonar graph can be tricky, but some key characteristics can help. Here's what to look for:

**Rock Signature:**

* **Return Strength:** A rock will typically show a strong, sharp return on the sonar graph. This translates to a tall, narrow peak on the graph. 
* **Echo Shape:** The echo from a rock will usually have a symmetrical shape, meaning the peak rises and falls evenly. 
* **Target Size:** Depending on the size of the rock, the echo might occupy a small or medium area on the horizontal axis (representing distance from the sonar).

**Mine Signature:**

* **Return Strength:** Mines can also show a strong return, but it might not be as sharp as a rock. The peak on the graph might be broader or have a slight double peak. 
* **Echo Shape:** The echo from a mine can be less symmetrical than a rock. This is because the mine might have internal structures or cavities that cause the sound wave to bounce back in a more complex way.
* **Target Size:** Mines often have a larger footprint on the sonar graph compared to a rock. This is because the sonar might be reflecting off various features within the mine like tunnels, walls, or collapsed areas.

**Here's a table summarizing the key differences:**

| Feature | Rock | Mine |
|---|---|---|
| Return Strength | Strong, Sharp Peak | Strong, Broader Peak (might have double peak) |
| Echo Shape | Symmetrical | Less Symmetrical |
| Target Size | Small to Medium | Large |

**Additional factors to consider:**

* **Depth:** Rocks and mines can be located at different depths depending on the context. 
* **Sonar Settings:**  The resolution and frequency of the sonar can affect how clearly these features are displayed.

**Overall:** While interpreting sonar graphs requires experience, these characteristics can give you a good starting point to differentiate between rocks and mines.  For a more definitive answer, it's often recommended to combine sonar data with other techniques like visual inspection or underwater surveys.
